While updating my modpacks, I've noticed that a ton of items have broken localization or typos - and I figured I'd combine and publish the resource packs I use to fix them all (that way I can easily add it to every pack).

Make sure this pack loads first (at the top of the list) to ensure it overrides other packs.

You can suggest mods I should fix in the comments, on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/vizthex123/NameFixer/issues), or on the [discord server](https://discord.com/invite/NtwzA6X).
